# Head-Position-Corrector
This software is a simple head position detector and corrector which can help people who spend a long time staring at computers everyday to keep a healthy head posture. 
It can detect the user's head positions using USB camera and can give warnings when the user is in a bad position or has stayed the same position for a long time. 
The software is based on OpenCV(in C) and .NET(in C# and XAML).
